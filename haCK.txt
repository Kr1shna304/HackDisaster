5 points: proposed solution method (relevance of ideas and approach to the task, completeness of the problem, complexity of implementation);
10 points: prototype (working minimum functionality, demonstration of capabilities, examples of application);
5 points: presentation (timing, clarity, accuracy of presentation, answering questions, clarifying details of the approach and implementation).

Simulations such as Airsim, make a model of 
Try to use existing solutions, 

How might we assess building damage and estimate the cost of reconstruction working remotely using advanced technologies?

You can choose a subset of the challenge to address. It is up to your team! Dig in to understand the problem first before ideating solutions, and sprint to iterate your prototypes.
